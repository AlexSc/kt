Initial public release of the kt prototype language interpreter.

directory structure overview:

parser:
	parser executable - comprised of a simple python module that
	bridges in a custom lexical analyzer build with flex and a bison
	based parser.

interpreter:
	the bulk of the kt language platform prototype - program structure and
	semantic analysis, compilation to intermediate language representation
	and virtual machine.

test:
	test cases for various language features.

license:
	source code licensing information.  Initial version released under MIT
	license (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)

media:
	media/branding around language and environment.

To test it all out, just run the test.sh in the root directory - it will
build the parser and execute the first unit test which should echo a bunch
of debug messages and a simple greeting.
